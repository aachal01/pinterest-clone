## What I Learned

Through the process of creating this Pinterest UI clone, I gained practical knowledge in several areas:

- **HTML Structure:** I improved my ability to structure a webpage using HTML elements and semantic tags to represent different sections of the Pinterest interface.

- **CSS Styling:** I refined my skills in using CSS to style various components, including the navigation bar, search bar, and image grid. This included customizing colors, fonts, and spacing.

- **Flexbox Layout:** I utilized CSS flexbox to create responsive and flexible layouts, aligning elements both horizontally and vertically within the image grid.

- **Responsive Design:** I learned how to make the interface responsive by adjusting styles for different screen sizes. This ensured that the layout maintains its functionality and aesthetics on various devices.

- **Interactive Elements:** I added interactive elements, such as hover effects on images and navigation items. This enhanced user experience and provided visual feedback.

- **Sticky Header:** I implemented a sticky header using CSS to keep the navigation bar at the top of the page as the user scrolls.

- **CSS Variables:** I leveraged CSS variables to maintain consistency in colors and sizes throughout the project. This practice improved code readability and ease of maintenance.
